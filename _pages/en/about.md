Hi! My name is Francisco Mu√±oz, and I am a Data Scientist with experience in developing predictive models and data analysis. I hold a degree in Civil Mathematical Engineering and a Master's in Applied Mathematics from the University of Chile. Throughout my career, I have worked on projects in various fields, including transportation, health, education, and mining. In these projects, I have used data science tools, deep learning, machine learning, optimization models, and stochastic processes.

In my free time, I enjoy cooking and coffee. I love trying new recipes, learning cooking techniques, and improving them.
