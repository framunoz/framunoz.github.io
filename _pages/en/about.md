Hi! I'm Francisco Mu√±oz, a Mathematical Civil Engineer with a Master's in Applied Mathematics from the University of Chile. I specialize in data science, with experience in developing predictive models and data analysis. I consider myself a critical thinker, resilient, and creative, with strong communication skills to work effectively in multidisciplinary teams.

Throughout my career, I have worked on projects in transportation, healthcare, education, and mining. In these projects, I have applied data science, deep learning, machine learning, optimization models, and stochastic processes.

I am motivated by solving complex problems with an analytical and technical approach, always striving for innovation and impact. I aspire to contribute to a more sustainable and efficient world through the intelligent use of data.

If you're interested in learning more about my work or exploring collaboration opportunities, feel free to reach out. I check my emails frequently and will be happy to respond. You can also connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/femunozg/?locale=en_US) to keep sharing ideas and opportunities.
