Hi! I'm Francisco Mu√±oz, a Mathematical Civil Engineer with a Master's in Applied Mathematics from the University of Chile. I specialize in data science, with experience in developing predictive models and data analysis. I consider myself a critical thinker, resilient, and creative, with strong communication skills for working effectively in multidisciplinary teams.

Throughout my career, I have worked on projects in transportation, healthcare, education, and mining. In these projects, I have applied data science tools, deep learning, machine learning, optimization models, and stochastic processes.

I am driven by solving complex problems with an analytical and technical approach, always striving to innovate and create impact. My goal is to contribute to a more sustainable and efficient world through the intelligent use of data.

If you are interested in finding out more about my work or exploring opportunities for collaboration, please do not hesitate to
[contact me](mailto:fmunoz@ug.uchile.cl). I check my emails frequently and will be happy to get back to you. You can also connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/femunozg/) to continue sharing ideas and opportunities.
